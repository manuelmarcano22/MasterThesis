To finish we come back to the four open questions about CVs in globular clusters discussed in the introduction. 

\section{Primordial CVs}


In this work we studied the population of CVs in NGC 6397. Previous photometric and X-ray studies of this cluster have identified a sample of 15 CV candidates. In this work we located the candidates on the MUSE observations to examine their spectral signature and extent the sample of spectroscopically confirmed CV candidates. From the sample we were able to unambiguously identify 5 CVs via their bright H$\alpha$ line in emission, sign of an accretion disk. We have obtained the spectra of two new CVs, one of the spectra being the first one from a CV outside the cluster center. Increasing the sample size of CV spectra, and looking at the CVs in different locations in the cluster, increases the chances of detecting the predicted populations of CVs. For the CV candidates farther from the cluster center (with one exception) no H$\alpha$ line was detected. This suggest that these might belong to a different kind of 'faint' CV population. Their radial distribution and their weak H$\alpha$ emission might suggest that these are primordial CVs. CVs from primordial origins are expected to be near the minimum period and have their optical spectra dominated by the white dwarf as the companion is a highly evolved and drained main sequence star. An hydrogen emission is still expected but probably weakened and inside broad absorption lines signature of a white dwarf. The lack of bright hydrogen lines from these object also leaves the door open to the possibility of seen white dwarfs accreting from helium dwarf companion. This are of great as gravitational waves sources for futures missions like eLISA. Such types of CVs have never been identify in globular clusters although they are predicted to exist. Deeper observation will MUSE are needed to get spectra with good signal-to-noise ratio and correctly classify them as such. 

Studying the companion stars of the CVs can also give us a clue about primordial CVs, as dynamically formed CVs are expected to have a bias towards having a more massive companion. On none of the obtained spectra we observed signature of a M star (TiO lines e.g \citep{Marsh_secondary_1990}). This suggest that the companion stars might possibly be a K type star ($0.54 - 0.9 \text M _\odot$ \citep{gray2005observation}. Knowing that the turnoff mass~\footnote{the turn off mass is the maximum mass on the main sequence. This can serve as a rough estimate of the maximum mass of main sequence stars in a globular clusters.} is $0.77 M_\odot$ for NGC 6397 \citep{de_marco_spectroscopic_2005}. This gives us a range of $\sim 0.5 - 0.8 \text M _\odot$. Leaving the possibility for the companion to be either a M type star or even a low mass white dwarf or helium dwarf.

\section{Periods}

As mentioned before the H$\alpha$ emission line was used to detect radial velocity variations in the CVs. Since the period of U23 is known, we used it as a check if radial velocity could be detected in the short exposures taken by MUSE. However, since the method depends on the strength of the emission line (and the integration time required to detect it significantly), the short exposures available were not enough to be able to unambiguously detect radial velocity shits. This suggest that longer integration time ($> 25$ seconds) is needed to be able to determine the period of the CVS in NGC 6397 with the MUSE instrument. Exposures of a few minutes ($\sim 6 m$) with the data of two separated nights combined a determination of radial velocity shift could be done. With longer exposures spread apart of globular clusters MUSE would be able to trace simultaneously the radial velocity shift of multiple objects allowing the possibility of the determination of the orbital parameters of binaries in globular clusters. This is of great interest as the number of CVs in globular clusters is very low.  

\section{Magnetism and dwarf novae}

 As mentioned before it has been proposed that the majority of CVs in globular clusters are magnetic \citep{grindlay_magnetic_1999}. For NGC 6397, remarkably, all 4 previously identified CVs show prominent Helium II lines. These line are generally associated with magnetic and nova-like CVs \citep{echevarria_statistical_1988}. We did not detect any Helium II line in any of the two newly studied spectra (U10 and U22). This might suggest that they are not magnetic in nature. However, this is not conclusive as the strongest He II line is outside of the MUSE spectral range ($4686 \mathring{A}$). This means that the possibility that the two newly identified CVs are magnetic have not been completely ruled out. 

 Regarding the dwarf novae, U22 showed a moderate increase in magnitude compared to previous observation. This is not irrefutable evidence that U22 was observed during an outburst and photometric follow up to study the variability is needed for confirmation. If U22 is indeed a dwarf novae it would be the third one identify in NGC 6397 \citep{shara_erupting_2005} and contribute to the still small sample of DN outburst spectra (37 out of 1600 CVs \citep{2001PASP..113..764D}). The fact that only one DN in outburst candidate was identify supports the claim made by \cite{shara_CVsDN_1996} that DNs are very rare in globular clusters. There are many caveats with the assumptions made as the estimated rates of DN are mainly empirical and can suffer from selection bias due to the fact that observations of bright and long period outbursts are easier to detect. \\ 

Altogether we have demonstrated how an IFU like MUSE can be used to study the population of compact objects in globular clusters. Here we exposed some hints that field CVs and GC population are different and the dynamics of the overall globular cluster plays a role on the formation of compact objects. Deeper observations at different epochs is needed to constraint the current models on the evolution of globular clusters and formation of binaries in them. MUSE is a well fitted instrument for the task as it allows to study the variability and spectral features of a high number of objects simultaneously. This open the way for the discovery of new objects in globular clusters and increase our understating on them and their constituents. For this work we were limited by the very short exposure times. This is mainly because these observations took place during the commissioning period and so were constrained by the overall commission goals. MUSE is now in regular observation time and among its future and current targets there is a number of other galactic globular cluster. Also improvement in the instrument are expected soon, like for example the use of adaptive optic and the narrow field mode. This means  a vast number of new data set that can be exploited to improve our understanding on the formation of compact objects in globular clusters.
