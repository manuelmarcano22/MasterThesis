grating-dispersed spectrographs. We discuss how to optimize dispersive elements, such as VPH gratings, to achieve adequate spectral resolution, high throughput, and efficient data packing to maximize spatial sampling for 3D spectroscopy. We review and compare the various coupling methods that make these spectrographs ``3D,'' including fibers, lenslets, slicers, and filtered multi-slits. We also describe Fabry-Perot and spatial-heterodyne interferometers, pointing out their advantages as field-widened systems relative to conventional, grating-dispersed spectrographs. We explore the parameter space all these instruments sample, highlighting regimes open for exploitation. Present instruments provide a foil for future development. We give an overview of plans for such future instruments on today's large telescopes, in space, and in the coming era of extremely large telescopes. Currently-planned
instruments open new domains, but also leave significant areas of parameter space vacant, beckoning further development.},

The authors review the history of their discovery, and of the realisation that their structure is determined by the physics of the degenerate electron gas. Spectral types and surface chemical composition show a complicated pattern dominated by diffusion processes and their interaction with accretion, convection and mass loss. While this interaction is not completely understood in all its detail at present, the study may ultimately lead to important constraints on the theory of stellar evolution in general. Variability, caused by nonradial oscillations of the star, is a common phenomenon and is shown to be a powerful probe of the structure of deeper layers that are not directly accessible to observation. Very strong magnetic fields detected in a small fraction of white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to study the behaviour of atoms under conditions that cannot be simulated in terrestrial laboratories.},

Depending upon the mass accretion rate, the outer parts of disks in cataclysmic variables are optically thin in the optical continuum, and radiate a line spectrum which is superposed upon the thermal continuum emitted by the inner disk. The Balmer lines and Ca II H and K emission which are observed in dwarf novae at quiescence can be explained by the emission from the optically thin outer regions of the disks; however, the He I and He II lines must be produced by a different mechanism. This theory predicts that the peak fluxes of the Balmer lines in cataclysmic variables should fall on a Planck curve of temperature of about 7000 K.},

The effect of the Keplerian velocity gradient on the transfer of line radiation in the disk is taken into account to first order in H/R. Line photons that are trapped in an optically thick emission layer can escape more easily in directions along which the Keplerian shear flow provides large Doppler gradients. This anisotropy in the local emission pattern alters the shape of the global emission line profile. Synthetic emission line profiles are presented for the optically thick and optically thin limits and covering a full range of inclinations. The resemblance between the present high-inclination optically thick line profiles and the observed profiles of Balmer emission lines in eclipsing dwarf novae indicates that this local saturation effect is an important element of the line formation process in real disks.},

We confirm the presence of a fourth cataclysmic variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (hereafter CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al. to present evidence that CVs 1-4 all have faint disks and probably low accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the published spectra of Grindlay et al., we present new evidence that CVs 1-3 may be DQ Her systems, as originally suggested by Grindlay et al., and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as "nonflickerers" (NFs). Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the cluster center. Using detailed comparisons with stellar atmosphere models, we have determined log g =6.25 ± 1.0 and T eff =17,500 ± 5,000 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the luminosity of the NF, we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium WD having a mass of 0.25 M ☉ and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr (depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD.},

        abstract = {We review the properties of the DQ Herculis stars: cataclysmic variables containing an accreting, magnetic, rapidly rotating white dwarf. These stars are characterized by strong X-ray emission, high-excitation spectra, and very stable optical and X-ray pulsations in their light curves. There is considerable resemblance to their more famous cousins, the AM Herculis stars, but the latter class is additionally
characterized by spin-orbit synchronism and the presence of strong circular polarization. We list eighteen stars passing muster as certain or very likely DQ Her stars. The rotational periods range from 33 s to 2.0 hr. Additional periods can result when the rotating searchlight illuminates other structures in the binary. A single hypothesis explains most of the observed properties: magnetically channeled accretion within a truncated disk. Some accretion flow still seems to proceed directly to the magnetosphere, however. The white dwarfs' magnetic moments are in the range 1032 - 1034 G cc, slightly weaker than in AM Her stars but with some probable overlap. The more important reason why DQ Hers have broken synchronism is probably their greater accretion rate and orbital separation. The observed
Lx/LV values are surprisingly low for a radially accreting white dwarf, suggesting that most of the accretion energy is not radiated in a strong shock above the magnetic pole. The fluxes can be more satisfactorily explained if most of the radial infall energy manages to bypass the shock and deposit itse lf directly in the white dwarf photosphere, where it should emerge as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. This also provides an adequate source of ionizing photons to power the high-excitation optical and UV emission lines. This is probably the DQ Her analog to the famous 'soft X-ray excess' in AM Her stars. However, unlike the AM Her case, this radiation has not been directly observed, so the analogy must not (yet) be embraced too firmly. There is some conventional wisdom today which segregates the
short-period from the long-period DQ Her stars. But the observational grounds for this distinction are slim, except in one respect: X-ray emission from short-period systems appears to be weaker and softer. This must be due to the shallower depth of the potential well, and/or the greater difficulty the fast rotators have in enforcing radial accretion flow.},

We confirm the presence of a fourth cataclysmic variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (hereafter CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al. to present evidence that CVs 1-4 all have faint disks and probably low accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the published spectra of Grindlay et al., we present new evidence that CVs 1-3 may be DQ Her systems, as originally suggested by Grindlay et al., and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as "nonflickerers" (NFs). Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the cluster center. Using detailed comparisons with stellar atmosphere models, we have determined log g =6.25 ± 1.0 and T eff =17,500 ± 5,000 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the luminosity of the NF, we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium WD having a mass of 0.25 M ☉ and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr (depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD.},

        abstract = {The observational data for the 124 cataclysmic and low-mass X-ray binaries of known orbital period are compiled. It is found that the eruption properties are very well correlated with the orbital periods, in a manner that suggests that the mass transfer is the all-important determinant of evolution and of the eruptive behavior. Transfer rates of 10 to the -11th to 10 to the -7th solar mass/year are found, which are well correlated with orbital period. It is concluded that the mechanism which drives these systems is the magnetic braking of the secondary's rotation by its own stellar wind, coupled with the enforcement of synchronous rotation by tidal friction. This permits CVs to lose sufficient angular momentum to begin mass transfer in a reasonable time and drives the mass transfer at a high rate once it begins. An account of the long-lived phases of CV evolution is given.},
