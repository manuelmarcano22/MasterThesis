grating-dispersed spectrographs. We discuss how to optimize dispersive elements, such as VPH gratings, to achieve adequate spectral resolution, high throughput, and efficient data packing to maximize spatial sampling for 3D spectroscopy. We review and compare the various coupling methods that make these spectrographs ``3D,'' including fibers, lenslets, slicers, and filtered multi-slits. We also describe Fabry-Perot and spatial-heterodyne interferometers, pointing out their advantages as field-widened systems relative to conventional, grating-dispersed spectrographs. We explore the parameter space all these instruments sample, highlighting regimes open for exploitation. Present instruments provide a foil for future development. We give an overview of plans for such future instruments on today's large telescopes, in space, and in the coming era of extremely large telescopes. Currently-planned
instruments open new domains, but also leave significant areas of parameter space vacant, beckoning further development.},

The authors review the history of their discovery, and of the realisation that their structure is determined by the physics of the degenerate electron gas. Spectral types and surface chemical composition show a complicated pattern dominated by diffusion processes and their interaction with accretion, convection and mass loss. While this interaction is not completely understood in all its detail at present, the study may ultimately lead to important constraints on the theory of stellar evolution in general. Variability, caused by nonradial oscillations of the star, is a common phenomenon and is shown to be a powerful probe of the structure of deeper layers that are not directly accessible to observation. Very strong magnetic fields detected in a small fraction of white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to study the behaviour of atoms under conditions that cannot be simulated in terrestrial laboratories.},

Depending upon the mass accretion rate, the outer parts of disks in cataclysmic variables are optically thin in the optical continuum, and radiate a line spectrum which is superposed upon the thermal continuum emitted by the inner disk. The Balmer lines and Ca II H and K emission which are observed in dwarf novae at quiescence can be explained by the emission from the optically thin outer regions of the disks; however, the He I and He II lines must be produced by a different mechanism. This theory predicts that the peak fluxes of the Balmer lines in cataclysmic variables should fall on a Planck curve of temperature of about 7000 K.},

The effect of the Keplerian velocity gradient on the transfer of line radiation in the disk is taken into account to first order in H/R. Line photons that are trapped in an optically thick emission layer can escape more easily in directions along which the Keplerian shear flow provides large Doppler gradients. This anisotropy in the local emission pattern alters the shape of the global emission line profile. Synthetic emission line profiles are presented for the optically thick and optically thin limits and covering a full range of inclinations. The resemblance between the present high-inclination optically thick line profiles and the observed profiles of Balmer emission lines in eclipsing dwarf novae indicates that this local saturation effect is an important element of the line formation process in real disks.},

We confirm the presence of a fourth cataclysmic variable (CV) in NGC 6397 (hereafter CV 4), and we use the photometry of Cool et al. to present evidence that CVs 1-4 all have faint disks and probably low accretion rates. By combining these results with new UV spectra of CV 1 and the published spectra of Grindlay et al., we present new evidence that CVs 1-3 may be DQ Her systems, as originally suggested by Grindlay et al., and we show that CV 4 may either be a dwarf nova or another magnetic system. Another possibility is that the CVs could be old novae in hibernation between nova eruptions. We also present the first spectrum of a member of a new class of UV bright stars in NGC 6397. These faint, hot stars do not vary, unlike the CVs, and are thus denoted as "nonflickerers" (NFs). Like the CVs, their spatial concentration is strongly concentrated toward the cluster center. Using detailed comparisons with stellar atmosphere models, we have determined log g =6.25 ± 1.0 and T eff =17,500 ± 5,000 K for this NF. Using these line parameters and the luminosity of the NF, we show that the NF spectrum is consistent with a helium WD having a mass of 0.25 M ☉ and an age between 0.1 and 0.5 Gyr (depending on the models used). The NF spectrum appears to be significantly Doppler shifted from the expected wavelength, suggesting the presence of a dark, massive companion, probably a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD.},

        abstract = {We review the properties of the DQ Herculis stars: cataclysmic variables containing an accreting, magnetic, rapidly rotating white dwarf. These stars are characterized by strong X-ray emission, high-excitation spectra, and very stable optical and X-ray pulsations in their light curves. There is considerable resemblance to their more famous cousins, the AM Herculis stars, but the latter class is additionally
characterized by spin-orbit synchronism and the presence of strong circular polarization. We list eighteen stars passing muster as certain or very likely DQ Her stars. The rotational periods range from 33 s to 2.0 hr. Additional periods can result when the rotating searchlight illuminates other structures in the binary. A single hypothesis explains most of the observed properties: magnetically channeled accretion within a truncated disk. Some accretion flow still seems to proceed directly to the magnetosphere, however. The white dwarfs' magnetic moments are in the range 1032 - 1034 G cc, slightly weaker than in AM Her stars but with some probable overlap. The more important reason why DQ Hers have broken synchronism is probably their greater accretion rate and orbital separation. The observed
Lx/LV values are surprisingly low for a radially accreting white dwarf, suggesting that most of the accretion energy is not radiated in a strong shock above the magnetic pole. The fluxes can be more satisfactorily explained if most of the radial infall energy manages to bypass the shock and deposit itse lf directly in the white dwarf photosphere, where it should emerge as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation. This also provides an adequate source of ionizing photons to power the high-excitation optical and UV emission lines. This is probably the DQ Her analog to the famous 'soft X-ray excess' in AM Her stars. However, unlike the AM Her case, this radiation has not been directly observed, so the analogy must not (yet) be embraced too firmly. There is some conventional wisdom today which segregates the
short-period from the long-period DQ Her stars. But the observational grounds for this distinction are slim, except in one respect: X-ray emission from short-period systems appears to be weaker and softer. This must be due to the shallower depth of the potential well, and/or the greater difficulty the fast rotators have in enforcing radial accretion flow.},

observe the collapsed core of the nearby globular cluster NGC 6397, we
report the first spectra of stars well below the main-sequence turnoff
near the center of a dense globular star cluster. The spectra confirm
our WFPC1 photometry that these objects are almost certainly the
long-sought population of cataclysmic variables (CVs) in globulars, and
that they are the likely counterparts for the recently discovered
(ROSAT) low-luminosity X-ray sources in this cluster. The spectra
suggest the CVs are magnetic (DQ Her type), raising the intriguing
possibility that magnetic white dwarfs are preferentially produced in
globular cluster cores.},

Transfer rates of 10 to the -11th to 10 to the -7th solar mass/year are found, which are well correlated with orbital period. It is concluded that the mechanism which drives these systems is the magnetic braking of the secondary's rotation by its own stellar wind, coupled with the enforcement of synchronous rotation by tidal friction. This permits CVs to lose sufficient angular momentum to begin mass transfer in a reasonable time and drives the mass transfer at a high rate once it begins.

We consider observations made not only with photons, ranging from radio waves to X-rays, but also those involving neutrinos and gravity waves. We detail how precision determinations of structural properties would lead to significant restrictions on the poorly understood equation of state near and beyond the equilibrium density of nuclear matter. To begin, a theoretical analysis of neutron star structure, including general relativistic limits to mass, compactness, and spin rates is made. A review is the made of recent observations such as pulsar timing (which leads to mass, spin period, glitch and moment of inertia
estimates), optical and X-ray observations of cooling neutron stars (which lead to estimates of core temperatures and ages and inferences about the internal composition), and X-ray observations of accreting and bursting sources (which shed light on both the crustal properties and internal composition). Next, we discuss neutrino emission from
proto-neutron stars and how neutrino observations of a supernova, from both current and planned detectors, might impact our knowledge of the interiors, mass and radii of neutron stars. We also explore the question of how superstrong magnetic fields could affect the equation of state and neutron star structure. This is followed by a look at binary mergers involving neutron stars and how the detection of gravity waves could unambiguously distinguish normal neutron stars from self-bound strange quark matter stars.},

In some cases, the resulting potentials do not exhibit the familiar contact surfaces of the classical Roche potential. The concept of a contact surface, which has been fundamental to the investigations of close binary systems, must be used with discretion for close binaries in which one component is very luminous. A convenient criterion for the existence of a contact surface is given by (1-μ) ≃
3δc 3/2 (1 - 2(tfrac\{2\}\{3\}){\textasciicircum}4 δ \_c ),
(δc≪1) where μ is the mass of the very luminous
star in terms of the system mass. For systems of given μ, no contact surface exists if δ is greater than δc where
δ is the ratio of radiation pressure force to gravitational
attraction. Furthermore, energy considerations of the modified Roche potential indicate that binary systems with δ {\textless}
δc should have a greater tendency to form rings than
those with δ {\textless} δc.},

        abstract = {Context: The lower limit for the mass of white dwarfs (WDs) with a C-O core is commonly assumed to be roughly 0.5 M⊙. As a
consequence, WDs of lower masses are usually identified as He-core remnants. Aims: When the initial mass of the progenitor star is between 1.8 and 3 M\_⊙, which corresponds to the so-called red giant (RGB) phase transition, the mass of the H-exhausted core at the tip of the RGB is 0.3 {\textless} M\_H/M⊙ {\textless} 0.5. Prompted by this
well known result of stellar evolution theory, we investigate the possibility to form C-O WDs with mass M {\textless} 0.5 M⊙. Methods: The pre-WD evolution of stars was computed with initial mass of about 2.3 M\_⊙, undergoing anomalous mass-loss episodes during the RGB phase and leading to the formation of WDs with He-rich or CO-rich cores. The cooling sequences of the resulting WDs are also described. Results: We show that the minimum mass for a C-O WD is about 0.33 M⊙, so that both He and C-O core WDs can exist in the mass range 0.33-0.5 M⊙. The models computed for the
present paper provide the theoretical tools for indentifying the observational counterpart of very low-mass remnants with a C-O core among those commonly ascribed to the He-core WD population in the progressively growing sample of observed WDs of low mass. Moreover, we show that the central He-burning phase of the stripped progeny of the 2.3 M\_⊙ star lasts longer and longer as the total mass decreases. In particular, the M = 0.33 M⊙ model takes about 800 Myr to exhaust its central helium, which is more than three times longer than the value for the standard 2.3 M⊙ star: it is, by far, the longest core-He burning lifetime. Finally, we find the occurrence of gravonuclear instabilities during the He-burning shell phase.},

instability within the disk. It is demonstrated that this accretion model naturally explains amplitudes of outbursts and the

        abstract = {Radio emission from non-magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs, accreting white dwarfs) could allow detailed studies of outflows and possibly accretion flows in these nearby, numerous and non-relativistic compact accretors. Up to now, however, very few CVs have been detected in the radio. We have conducted a VLA pilot survey of four close and optically-bright novalike CVs at 6 GHz, detecting three, and thereby doubling the number of radio detections of these systems. RW Sex, V603 Aql and the old nova TT Ari were detected in both of the epochs, while V1084 Her was not detected (to a \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ upper-limit of 7.8 \${\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}rm\{Jy\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{beam\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). These observations clearly show that the sensitivity of previous surveys was typically too low to detect these objects and that non-magnetic CVs can indeed be significant radio emitters. The three detected sources show a range of properties, including flaring and variability on both short (\${\textbackslash}sim\$200 s) and longer-term (days) time-scales, as well as circular polarization levels of up to 100{\textbackslash}\%. The spectral indices range from steep to inverted; TT Ari shows a spectral turnover at \${\textbackslash}sim\$6.5 GHz, while the spectral index of V603 Aql flattened from \${\textbackslash}alpha=0.54{\textbackslash}pm0.05\$ to \$0.16{\textbackslash}pm0.08\$ (\$F\_\{{\textbackslash}nu\}{\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}nu{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$) in the week between observations. This range of properties suggests that more than one emission process can be responsible for the radio emission in non-magnetic CVs. In this sample we find that individual systems are consistent with optically thick synchrotron emission, gyrosynchrotron emission or cyclotron maser emission.},

        abstract = {AM CVn stars are the outcome of a fine-tuned binary star evolution pathway. They are helium-rich and their binary orbital periods are less than 65 minutes. They evolve through one or two common envelope (CE) events, which are difficult to model. Observations of AM CVn stars are important to understand the CE phase. Thanks to intensive observing campaigns, the number of AM CVn stars has increased from 5 to 25 during the last 15 yr. We have witnessed long photometric campaigns,
time-resolved spectroscopy, UV and X-ray observations, and progress in modeling of the internal structure of donor and accretor stars, disk structure, disk atmosphere, and their evolution. Two possible new members of the AM CVn family have orbital periods of less than 10 minutes. For these, four different models have been proposed, including one without mass transfer, driven by electricity generated by the secondary star moving in the magnetic field of the primary. Short-period AM CVn stars are among the first possible detectable sources of
low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) radiation. They are also possible progenitors of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and subluminous explosions, and they can produce helium novae during their evolution. From
systematic searches in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, it has been possible to estimate population densities that can be tested against population synthesis models. One important question to investigate is the relative importance of the three proposed birth channels: a low-mass white dwarf donor, a helium-star donor, or a highly evolved cataclysmic variable (CV) as a donor. A review of the research on AM CVn stars covering the last 15 yr is given, and the outlook for future research is discussed.},

simulations, we identify the dominant formation channels and we predict
the expected numbers and characteristics of detectable systems,
emphasizing how the cluster sources differ from the field population. We
explore the dependence of formation rates on cluster properties and we
explain in particular why the distribution of CVs has only a weak
dependence on cluster density. We also discuss the frequency of dwarf
nova outbursts in GCs and their connection with moderately strong WD
magnetic fields. We examine the rates of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) via
both single and double degenerate channels in clusters and we argue that
those rates may contribute to the total SN Ia rate in elliptical
galaxies. Considering coalescing WD binaries, we discuss possible
constraints on the common envelope evolution of their progenitors and we
derive theoretical expectations for gravitational wave detection by
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).},

Follow-up spectroscopy of the initial 3 CV candidates in NGC 6397 with the FOS on HST suggests they may be magnetic CVs of the intermediate polar (IP) type, and follow-up deep imaging with both HST and ROSAT yield a 4th confirmed and 5th strong candidate CV near the center of this collapsed-core cluster. The optical versus X-ray
properties of the 4 confirmed IP candidates in NGC 6397 are compared with disk IPs, and arguments for and against this interpretation are presented. The possible strong excess of magnetic CVs in globulars will be tested with much deeper HST/AXAF surveys.},

field 3D spectroscopy with the new integral field spectrograph MUSE by
means of a spectroscopic analysis of more than 12 000 individual stars
in the globular cluster NGC 6397. Methods: The stars are
deblended with a point spread function fitting technique, using a
photometric reference catalogue from HST as prior, including relative
positions and brightnesses. This catalogue is also used for a first
analysis of the extracted spectra, followed by an automatic in-depth
analysis via a full-spectrum fitting method based on a large grid of
PHOENIX spectra. Results: We analysed the largest sample so far
available for a single globular cluster of 18 932 spectra from 12 307
stars in NGC 6397. We derived a mean radial velocity
of vrad = 17.84 ± 0.07 km s-1 and a mean
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.120 ± 0.002, with the latter seemingly
varying with temperature for stars on the red giant branch (RGB). We
determine Teff and [Fe/H] from the spectra, and log g from
HST photometry. This is the first very comprehensive Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram (HRD) for a globular cluster based on the analysis of several
thousands of stellar spectra, ranging from the main sequence to the tip
of the RGB. Furthermore, two interesting objects were identified; one is
a post-AGB star and the other is a possible millisecond-pulsar
companion.

globular cluster NGC 6397 based on more than {\textasciitilde}18,000 spectra obtained
with the novel integral field spectrograph MUSE. While NGC 6397 is often
considered a core collapse cluster, our analysis suggests a flattening
of the surface brightness profile at the smallest radii. Although it is
among the nearest globular clusters, the low velocity dispersion of NGC
6397 of {\textless}5km/s imposes heavy demands on the quality of the
kinematical data. We show that despite its limited spectral resolution,
MUSE reaches an accuracy of 1km/s in the analysis of stellar spectra. We
find slight evidence for a rotational component in the cluster and the
velocity dispersion profile that we obtain shows a mild central cusp. To
investigate the nature of this feature, we calculate spherical Jeans
models and compare these models to our kinematical data. This comparison
shows that if a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed, the addition of
an intermediate-mass black hole with a mass of 600M\_sun brings the model
predictions into agreement with our data, and therefore could be at the
origin of the velocity dispersion profile. We further investigate cases
with varying mass-to-light ratios and find that a compact dark stellar
component can also explain our observations. However, such a component
would closely resemble the black hole from the constant mass-to-light
ratio models as this component must be confined to the central {\textasciitilde}5arcsec
of the cluster and must have a similar mass. Independent constraints on
the distribution of stellar remnants in the cluster or kinematic
measurements at the highest possible spatial resolution should be able
to distinguish the two alternatives.},

These properties suggest the presence of a relativistic intrabinary shock formed due to interaction of a relativistic rotation-powered pulsar wind and outflow from the unusual "red-straggler/sub-subgiant" companion. We find the X-ray source U18 to show similar X-ray and optical properties to those of PSR J1740-5340, making it a strong MSP candidate. It exhibits variability on timescales from hours to years, also consistent with an intrabinary shock origin of its X-ray emission. The unprecedented depth of the X-ray data allows us to conduct a complete census of MSPs in NGC 6397. Based on the properties of the present sample of X-ray-detected MSPs in the Galaxy, we find that NGC 6397 probably hosts no more than six MSPs.},

        abstract = {We have searched for optical identifications for 79 Chandra X-ray 
sources that lie within the half-mass radius of the nearby,
core-collapsed globular cluster NGC 6397, using deep Hubble Space
Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel imaging in
Hα, R, and B. Photometry of these images allows us to classify
candidate counterparts based on color-magnitude diagram location. In
addition to recovering nine previously detected cataclysmic variables
(CVs), we have identified six additional faint CV candidates, a total of
42 active binaries (ABs), two millisecond pulsars, one candidate active
galactic nucleus, and one candidate interacting galaxy pair. Of the 79
sources, 69 have a plausible optical counterpart. The 15 likely and
possible CVs in NGC 6397 mostly fall into two groups: a brighter group
of six for which the optical emission is dominated by contributions from
the secondary and accretion disk and a fainter group of seven for which
the white dwarf dominates the optical emission. There are two possible
transitional objects that lie between these groups. The faintest CVs
likely lie near the minimum of the CV period distribution, where an
accumulation is expected. The spatial distribution of the brighter CVs
is much more centrally concentrated than those of the fainter CVs and
the ABs. This may represent the result of an evolutionary process in
which CVs are produced by dynamical interactions, such as exchange
reactions, near the cluster center and are scattered to larger orbital
radii, over their lifetimes, as they age and become fainter.},

        abstract = {The European Southern Observatory (ESO) develops and maintains a large number of instrument-specific data processing pipelines. These pipelines must produce standard-format output and meet the need for data archiving and the computation and logging of quality assurance parameters. As the number, complexity and data-output-rate of instrument increases, so does the challenge to develop and maintain the associated processing
software. ESO has developed the Common Pipeline Library (CPL) in order to unify the pipeline production effort and to minimise code
duplication. The CPL is a self-contained ISO-C library, designed for use in a C/C++ environment. It is designed to work with FITS data,
extensions and meta-data, and provides a template for standard
algorithms, thus unifying the look-and-feel of pipelines. It has been written in such a way to make it extremely robust, fast and generic, in order to cope with the operation-critical online data reduction
requirements of modern observatories. The CPL has now been successfully incorporated into several new and existing instrument systems. In order to achieve such success, it is essential to go beyond simply making the code publicly available, but also engage in training, support and promotion. There must be a commitment to maintenance, development, standards-compliance, optimisation, consistency and testing. This paper describes in detail the experiences of the CPL in all these areas. It covers the general principles applicable to any such software project and the specific challenges and solutions, that make the CPL unique.},

        abstract = {Reproducing experiments is vital to science. Being able to replicate, validate and extend previous work also speeds new research projects. Reproducing computational biology experiments, which are scripted, should be straightforward. But reproducing such work remains challenging and time consuming. In the ideal world we would be able to quickly and easily rewind to the precise computing environment where results were generated. We would then be able to reproduce the original analysis or perform new analyses. We introduce a process termed "continuous analysis" which provides inherent reproducibility to computational research at a minimal cost to the researcher. Continuous analysis combines Docker, a container service similar to virtual machines, with continuous integration, a popular software development technique, to automatically re-run computational analysis whenever relevant changes are made to the source code. This allows results to be reproduced quickly, accurately and without needing to contact the original authors. Continuous analysis also provides an audit trail for analyses that use data with sharing restrictions. This allows reviewers, editors, and readers to verify reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning any code.},

Relationships among the rise time, outburst length, decline time, quiescent interval, maximum V magnitude, and physical-system parameters such as orbital period and masses of the component stars were investigated. The results confirm some, but not all, of the correlations previously found for the best-studied system SS Cyg and other, less consistent, surveys. The autors use the long- and short-outburst separation characteristic of the SU UMa class to identify several prime suspects for this group.}
