WorldWideWeb. The information in the catalog includes up-to-date measurements for cluster distance, reddening, luminosity, colors and spectral types, velocity, structural and dynamical parameters,
horizontal branch morphology, metallicity, and other quantities. This catalog will be updated regularly and maintained in electronic form for widest possible accessibility.},

correlation is found between H-delta/H-beta and H-gamma/H-beta, although no correlation is found between H-alpha/H-beta and other Balmer ratios. This correlation is explained in terms of simple LTE calculations. It is shown that the intensity of He I 4471 A increases with H-lambda/H-beta. This relationship is not found in LTE accretion disk models. No
correlation is found for He II 4686 A. The observations do not support the anticorrelation between H-alpha/H-beta and H-lambda/H-beta indicated by the LTE calculations.},
